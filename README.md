# Godot Sonic Starter Kit
A Starter Kit for making a Sonic game in Godot. This will be for Godot 4.3, and will feature the barebones basic mechanics for a Sonic game, such as momentum, inertia, spin dash, boost, rings, item boxes, slopes, loops, goal posts, a simple badnik, dash pads, springs, etc. 
The purpose will be to make a starter kit for anyone to use to make a Sonic fan game, and just make it faster in general to start a new project. There will be a debug level, but building any subsequent levels, bosses, gimmicks will be on the developer.
